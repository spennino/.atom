If your cursor appears out of place, switch tabs and it'll sort itself out.\n  * Use \"Show scroll bars: When scrolling\" in System Preferences > General or your scrollbars will look like crap.\n  * The font used in the screenshots is [Inconsolata-g](https://github.com/brentd/neutron-syntax/blob/master/Inconsolata-g.otf?raw=true) at 15pt. If installed it'll be picked up automatically by the syntax theme.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/brentd/neutron-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/brentd/neutron-ui#readme","_id":"neutron-ui@0.4.0","_shasum":"e92dfadbe03b60f5b5e7aeb8c34510c45afd75f6","_resolved":"file:../d-118325-10529-6kxm85.075j98uxr/package.tgz","_from":"../d-118325-10529-6kxm85.075j98uxr/package.tgz"}
